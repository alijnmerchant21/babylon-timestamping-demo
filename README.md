# Babylon local deployment

This repository contains all the necessary artifacts and instructions to set up
and run a Babylon network locally, using several different deployment scenarios.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker Desktop

    All components are executed as Docker containers on the local machine, so a
    local Docker installation is required. Depending on your operating system,
    you can find relevant instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

2. Install `make`

    Required to build the service binaries. One tutorial that can be followed
    is [this](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/guides/make-install.html).

3. Set up an SSH key to GitHub

    Create a **non passphrase-protected** SSH key and add it to GitHub according
    to the instructions
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

4. Clone the repository and initialize git submodules

    The aforementioned components are included in the repo as git submodules, so
    they need to be initialized accordingly.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:babylonchain/babylon-deployment.git
    git submodule init && git submodule update
    ```

## Deployment scenarios

Every deployment scenario lives under the [deployments](deployments/) directory,
on a dedicated subdirectory.  The following scenarios are currently available:
- [BTC Staking (BTC backend: bitcoind)](deployments/btcstaking-bitcoind):
  Spawns a Babylon network showcasing Babylon's BTC Staking and BTC Timestamping protocols, backed by
  a bitcoind-based BTC simnet
- [BTC Timestamping (BTC backend: bitcoind)](deployments/timestamping-bitcoind):
  Spawns a Babylon network featuring Babylon's BTC Timestamping protocol,
  backed by a bitcoind-based BTC simnet
- [BTC Timestamping (BTC backend: btcd)](deployments/timestamping-btcd):
  Spawns a Babylon network featuring Babylon's BTC Timestamping protocol,
  backed by a btcd-based BTC simnet
- [Phase 1 Integration (BTC backend: bitcoind)](deployments/phase1-integration-bitcoind):
  Spawns a Babylon BTC Timestamping network testing Babylon's Phase 1 Integration with a gaiad
  testnet, backed by a bitcoind-based BTC simnet
- [Phase 2 Integration (BTC backend: bitcoind)](deployments/phase2-integration-bitcoind):
  Spawns a Babylon BTC Timestamping network testing Babylon's Phase 2 Integration with a wasmd
  testnet, backed by a bitcoind-based BTC simnet
- [Faucet](deployments/faucet):
  Spawns a Babylon network along with a Discord-based Faucet

### Subdirectory structure and deployment process

Each deployment scenario subdirectory follows the structure indicated below:

```shell
├── artifacts
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── ...
├── Makefile
├── post-deployment.sh
└── pre-deployment.sh
```

The Makefile generally adheres to the following template:

```shell
build-deployment-X:
...

start-deployment-X:
...

stop-deployment-X:
...
```

Initiating a deployment is achieved through `make start-deployment-X`. The
following events will occur automatically:

- Stop any existing deployment (by invoking the `make stop-deployment-X`
  command)
- (Re)Build Docker images for all the underlying services (by invoking the
  `make build-deployment-X` command)
- Execute the `pre-deployment.sh` bash script that will:
  - Create a genesis file used to bootstrap the Babylon network
  - Prepare service configuration originally placed under the `artifacts` folder
- Execute a `docker compose` command that will spin up all the required services
  for the network as Docker containers; the `docker-compose.yml` file is also
  under the `artifacts` folder
- Execute the `post-deployment.sh` bash script (if it exists) that will generate
  funded Babylon keyrings for the services that need to send Babylon
  transactions

## Deploying a Babylon network with a desired deployment scenario

The repository hosts a central [Makefile](Makefile) which places calls to all
the underlying Makefiles. It will be utilized to start deployments directly
from the repo root.

The whole deployment process can take 15-20 minutes, depending on the deployment
scenario and the available computing and networking resources.

Below, we document how to deploy each scenario. The following guidelines should
be followed:
- **For Linux systems, the make commands must be prefixed with `sudo`.**
- After having deployed a deployment scenario `X`, make sure to stop it through
  the corresponding `make` command that will be designated below before
  switching to another deployment scenario `Y`.

### BTC Staking (BTC backend: bitcoind)

To start the network **along with executing an
[additional post-deployment script](deployments/btcstaking-bitcoind/README.md#inspecting-the-btc-staking-protocol-demo)
that will showcase the full lifecycle of Babylon's BTC Staking Protocol**,
execute the following:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key NUM_FINALITY_PROVIDERS=3 start-deployment-btcstaking-bitcoind-demo
```

where:
- `BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY` is the full path to the private SSH key that you
  created and added to GitHub before. As mentioned, **this key must have no
  passphrase - otherwise the network startup will fail.** This applies for the
  rest of this document.
- `NUM_FINALITY_PROVIDERS` is the number of Finality Providers that will be
  created and used throughout the demo. We recommend utilizing 3 Finality
  Providers.

Alternatively, to just start the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-btcstaking-bitcoind
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key stop-deployment-btcstaking-bitcoind
```

### BTC Timestamping (BTC backend: bitcoind)

To start the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-timestamping-bitcoind
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key stop-deployment-timestamping-bitcoind
```

### BTC Timestamping (BTC backend: btcd)

To start the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-timestamping-btcd
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key stop-deployment-timestamping-btcd
```

### Phase 1 Integration (BTC backend: bitcoind)

To start the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-phase1-integration-bitcoind
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key stop-deployment-phase1-integration-bitcoind
```

### Phase 2 Integration (BTC backend: bitcoind)

To start the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key start-deployment-phase2-integration-bitcoind
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make BBN_PRIV_DEPLOY_KEY=/fullpath/to/private/ssh/key stop-deployment-phase2-integration-bitcoind
```

### Faucet

To start the network:

```shell
make start-deployment-faucet
```

To stop the network:

```shell
make stop-deployment-faucet
```
